**ABOUT THE DATASET**

**Dataset Variables**

**Dependent variables**: Age, Color, Discount applied, Frequency of purchases, Previous Purchases, Promo code used, Purchased Amount, Review Rating, and Subscription Status

**Independent variables**: Gender, location, payment method, season, and shipping type.

**Analysis Objective**

To understand shopping trends and customer behavior by analyzing product categories purchased, payment methods, seasonal patterns, shipping preferences, discount impact, demographics (gender and age), and both previous and total purchase activity across different purchase frequencies.

**Analysis that could be carried out:**

Examine customers behaviour on product categories

Finetune best product category on shipping type

Examine the overall purchased amount

Finetune previous purchases by customers

What season has the best customers turnover

Most rated products category by customers

Analyze gender performance

Determine which location has the best customers presence.

**OBSERAVTIONS**

**Top Purchased Location**

The top five locations — Montana, Berlin, California, Idaho, and Nevada — each have purchase amounts hovering around $5.5K. The spending levels are closely matched across these locations, which implies a geographically balanced customer base. However, the similarity also suggests no dominant market, which may mean there’s room to identify and develop a primary 
high-performing region.

**Customer Seasonal Purchase Trend**

Fall is clearly the peak season for customer purchases, totaling $80.02K, which is significantly higher than the other seasons. Spring ($58.68K) and Winter ($58.61K) follow closely, while Summer ($56.78K) shows the lowest spending. This trend strongly indicates that customer demand is influenced by seasonal factors, particularly end-of-year sales and holiday promotions.

**Customer Shipping Choice by Product Category**

Free Shipping ranks highest across nearly all categories, with the Clothing category generating the highest volume ($18.2K). Store Pickup is another well-used option, particularly for Footwear and Clothing, possibly due to convenience or cost-saving. Next Day Air and 2-Day Shipping options are least popular, particularly in categories like Accessories and Outerwear — likely due to higher associated costs or longer product consideration times. This reflects cost-conscious behavior and a preference for value-added services like free delivery.

**Total Spending by Gender**

Females contribute 67.74% of the total revenue, equating to $157.89K, while males contribute just 32.26% ($75.19K). This could be due to a larger number of female customers, higher frequency of purchases, or higher basket value among women. Indicates a gender imbalance in engagement that can be further explored and used for segmentation.

**Overall and Previous Purchase Amount**

Total current purchase value stands at $233.08K, while previous purchases are valued at 99K, indicating a strong returning customer base. The ratio of previous to current purchases implies that many customers are repeat buyers, reflecting high retention and possible brand loyalty.

**Purchase Frequency of Customer ID**

The majority of purchases occur “Every 3 Months”, with 564 customers in this frequency band. As the frequency increases (e.g., Monthly, Bi-weekly, Fortnightly), the number of customers drops gradually, ending with 539 fortnightly buyers. This indicates a moderate engagement cycle, where most customers make occasional purchases instead of buying frequently. High-frequency shoppers form a smaller but valuable segment that could be nurtured further.

**RECOMMENDATTIONS**

**Maximize Fall Season Sales**

Capitalize on the Fall trend by planning early campaigns
Extend momentum into early Winter with carry-over campaigns.

**Revamp Summer Strategy**

Summer is the lowest-performing season, possibly due to fewer buying holidays. Introduce summer-exclusive products, flash sales, or bundle discounts to boost sales. Consider seasonal themes like vacation gear, outdoor products, or limited-edition summer drops.

**Leverage Preferred Shipping Methods**

Reinforce and promote Free Shipping and Store Pickup, as these clearly align with customer preferences. Introduce “free shipping thresholds” (e.g., free shipping on orders over $50) to increase basket size. Offer time-limited discounted rates on Express or 2-Day shipping for faster delivery incentives, especially during key seasons.

**Strengthen Regional Targeting**

Although all top five locations have nearly equal spending, deeper insights may reveal: Customer behavior differences by location and Product preferences or seasonal trends, Launch location-specific promotions, especially in underperforming regions outside the top five.

**Upsell and Cross-Sell Through Frequency Insights**
